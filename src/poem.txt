Title: The Labyrinth of Existence
Author: Franz Kafka

In the labyrinth of existence,              +-----+-----+-----------+
We wander aimlessly to and fro,                   |     |           |
Lost in a maze of doubt and fear,           +--+  +--+  +--+  +-----+
And unsure of where to go.                  |     |  |              |
We stumble blindly in the dark,             |  +--+  |  +  +--------+
Seeking out a guiding light,                |  |  |  |  |           |
Hoping for a glimmer of hope,               |  |  |  +--+  +--------+
To lead us through the night.               |  |  |  |  |  |        |
But all around us lies confusion,           |  |  +  +  |  |  +-----+
And our minds are filled with noise,        |  |        |  |        |
As we struggle to make sense of it all,     |  +--+  +  +  +  +--+  |
And find our rightful poise.                |        |           |  |
Through the twists and turns of life,       +--------+-----------+  +
We trudge through mud and dirt,
And yet, despite the hardships,
We’re driven to keep alert.
For in this labyrinth of existence,
There’s magic at every turn,
And if we keep our eyes open,
We’ll discover what we yearn.
We’ll find the hidden treasure,
That’s buried deep inside,
And we’ll come to know the truth,
That we no longer need to hide.
So let us wander bravely on,
And embrace the journey well,
For in the midst of the labyrinth,
We’ll find our own true selves.
